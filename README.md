## 👋 About Me

🙋‍♂️ Hello there! I'm a student from China, currently studying in the vibrant city of Chengdu📚. 

I have a deep passion for programming💻, and I'm proficient in languages like Python. Web development is another area that fascinates me. 

Feel free to click [here](https://www.mysticstars.cn) to visit my blog🌐, where I share more about my personal stories and dive into various technical topics. When I'm not coding, you can often find me immersed in Minecraft🎮. My in-game name is **Mystic_Stars**, and I enjoy survival mode, mini-games, and PVP. 

As an anime enthusiast🌸, I also love documenting the shows I've watched and enjoyed on my blog📺. If you would like to learn more about me, visit my [homepage website](https://me.mysticstars.cn).
